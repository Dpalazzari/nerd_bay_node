This app aims to achieve three goals:

1) Help the author (Dpalazzari) learn a brand new tech stack in familiar web design philosphies

2) Make a personal project the author is proud of.

3) Learn how to effectively test in a tech stack that is mostly a mystery. 

* This project has been put on the back burner for now *
